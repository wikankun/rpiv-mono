 *     skill or sending raw text — `skill` defaulting to the record key does
 *     NOT trip this, only an explicitly-set `skill`);
 *   - mutually exclusive with `fanout`/`iterate` loops (principled, not
 *     deferred: every unit's message comes from `units()`/`next()`, so a
 *     stage-level `prompt` would have no role). `assess` loops and `verify`
 *     COMPOSE: the stage's `prompt` is round/attempt 0's message and
 *     `feedForward` builds each retry's complete message (raw — no `/skill:`
 *     prefix to attach an arg to);
 *   - mutually exclusive with `reads` — a skill stage's `reads` auto-builds a
 *     labelled-flag arg, but a prompt stage's text is author-owned; rather than
 *     give `reads` two meanings, require the prompt to read `state.named`
 *     itself via its `PromptFn`;
