/**
 * The validation issue model — machine-readable codes, structured params,
 * ONE renderer.
 *
 * Every rule the validator enforces has exactly one entry in `ISSUE_DEFS`:
 * its severity (a property of the RULE, not the call site — so severity can
 * never drift between two emissions of the same rule) and its message
 * template. Checks report `(code, params)` through an `IssueReporter`; the
 * reporter renders the prose once, here. Consumers filter/assert on `code`
 * — never on message text (the message-regex control flow this replaces was
 * finding C5).
 *
 * Messages NEVER embed the stage name — `stage` is carried structurally on
 * the issue and display renderers compose the attribution
 * (`[layer] workflow "X" — stage "Y": …`, see `command-run.ts`). Params that
 * name OTHER entities (an edge's target, a publisher stage, a channel) do
 * appear in the prose — they're content, not attribution.
 *
 * Leaf module: no imports from the rest of the package (rule inputs that
 * come from domain tables — enum lists, bounds — arrive pre-rendered as
 * params, keeping this file dependency-free).
