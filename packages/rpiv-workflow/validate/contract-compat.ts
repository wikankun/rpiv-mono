/**
 * Contract / schema compatibility checks — the validator's only modules that
 * reach into the skill-contract domain (`adjudicateChannel`,
 * `compareDataChannel`, comparator registry) and the JSON-Schema bridge.
 * Kept apart from `stage-rules.ts` because the dependency footprint is
 * entirely different: these checks need the effective contract registry; the
 * stage rules need only the stage records.
 *
 * Enforcement layers (where each contract channel is adjudicated):
 *   - reads / wiring  → LOAD-TIME, complete (`checkReadsChannelCompat`, all
 *                       publishers, errors on signed mismatch — all stage kinds).
 *   - linear `data` + `status` → RUNTIME (`ensureContractInputValid`).
 *   - produces self-check → PRODUCE-TIME (`extraction.ts:effectiveOutputSchema`).
 *
 * Per-stage schema fallback (DECIDED, D4): when a stage carries no contract,
 * `checkEdgeSchemaCompat` falls back to the stage's own
 * `outputSchema`/`inputSchema`. That fallback lives HERE, not in harvest:
 * harvest derives per-SKILL contracts from dispatching stages only
 * (last-writer-wins per skill), while this check is edge-local and must also
 * cover non-dispatching (script/prompt) stages and direct `validateWorkflow`
 * calls that pass no contracts at all.
