/**
 * Skill contract data model.
 *
 * A contract declares what a skill consumes and produces, as data — the
 * keystone that lets an agent reason about composition without scanning prose.
 * The contract is the SKILL's property (declared once in its frontmatter),
 * injected into this framework via `registerSkillContracts` / a provider
 * (see `skill-contracts.ts`). This package never reads skill files or parses
 * YAML — the primary consumer (rpiv-pi) supplies already-parsed contracts.
 *
 * Three field tiers, by who understands them:
 *   - data channel (`consumes.data` / `produces.data`, JSON Schema) — the ONLY
 *     channel this framework adjudicates; JSON Schema is consumer-neutral.
 *   - framework-native structure (`produces.kind`, `consumes.reads`) — derived
 *     from `StageDef`, typed because the framework owns these concepts.
 *   - opaque consumer metadata (`meta`) — domain tags the framework stores and
 *     surfaces but NEVER interprets (e.g. an `artifactKind` / handle-kind under
 *     whatever model a consumer uses). A consumer whose skills emit raw JSON,
 *     API-sourced artifacts, or many-artifacts-per-skill puts that here without
 *     the framework needing to know the shape.
 * Every channel is optional — a pure chat side-effect declares none.
