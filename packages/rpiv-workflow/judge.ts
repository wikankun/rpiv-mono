/**
 * Judge — the first-class model-judge concept. A `Judge` names a dispatchable
 * grading session: a **skill** (`/skill:<judge.skill> <producerHandle>`, the
 * latest producer artifact auto-injected as the input handle) or a raw
 * **prompt** (the author embeds the handle/output themselves). Exactly one of
 * `skill` / `prompt` is the dispatch discriminator — enforced at CONSTRUCTION
 * by `judge()` (the `defineRoute` pattern: invalid shapes are unrepresentable
 * past the factory).
 *
 * A judge session runs as a `produces`-kind session so its verdict is
 * VALIDATED by `outcome` and published into its own dedicated
 * `state.named[outcome.name]` channel. What the verdict DECIDES lives on the
 * consuming site, not here: the `assess()` constructor adds `done(verdict)`;
 * a future per-stage `verify` hook adds pass/fail semantics; `panel()` will
 * compose N judges with a vote fold. Keeping the termination predicate off
 * `Judge` is what makes the concept reusable across all three.
 *
 * Leaf module — type-only imports; safe on the runner-free `registration`
 * surface (siblings register built-ins without dragging the runner in).
