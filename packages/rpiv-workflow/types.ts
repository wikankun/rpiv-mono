/**
 * Runtime types. Three nouns flow through the workflow runtime:
 *
 *  - `RunContext` — per-run carry (cwd, runId, workflow, state, visited,
 *    continueHost, registeredSkills, maxBackwardJumps). Read by every
 *    layer; mutated only by the runner.
 *  - `RunState` — mutable bookkeeping (output, counters, telemetry,
 *    termination). Read by every layer; mutated by the runner + the audit
 *    layer. Always read the chain's primary artifact via
 *    `currentPrimaryArtifact(state)` (internal-utils.ts) — it prefers
 *    `output.artifacts[0]` and falls back to `fallbackPrimaryArtifact`.
 *  - `WorkflowHostContext` — the host port (defined in `host.js`, re-exported
 *    here) threaded from `withSession` callbacks down through stage/phase
 *    helpers, so the runtime layers import all three nouns from one module.
 *
 * Per-stage / per-phase sessions extend a shared `SessionContext` base
 * (cwd, runId, state, prompt, skill). The audit layer pins its dependency
 * on this base structurally via `AuditCtx = Pick<SessionContext, ...>`.
 *
 * Lives apart from runner.ts / sessions.ts so both can reference the same
 * shapes without a runtime import cycle (type-only refs back via this
 * module are cycle-free).
