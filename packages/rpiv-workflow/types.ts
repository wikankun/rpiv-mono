 *    maxBackwardJumps). Read by every layer; mutated only by the runner.
 *  - `RunState` — mutable bookkeeping (manifest, counters, telemetry,
 *    termination). Read by every layer; mutated by the runner + the audit
 *    layer. Always read the current artifact path via
 *    `currentArtifactPath(state)` (internal-utils.ts) — it prefers
 *    `manifest.artifact_path` and falls back to `fallbackArtifactPath`.
 *  - `RunnerCtx` — Pi command ctx augmented with idle-await guarantees;
 *    threaded from `withSession` callbacks down through stage/phase helpers.
 *
 * Per-stage / per-phase sessions extend a shared `SessionContext` base
 * (cwd, runId, state, prompt, skill). The audit layer pins its dependency
 * on this base structurally via `AuditCtx = Pick<SessionContext, ...>`.
 *
 * Lives apart from runner.ts / sessions.ts so both can reference the same
 * shapes without a runtime import cycle (type-only refs back via this
 * module are cycle-free).
