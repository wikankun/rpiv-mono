/**
 * loop-kinds.ts — the per-loop-kind vocabulary and strategy table.
 *
 * Everything that varies BY KIND across the loop machinery lives here, in
 * one `Record<LoopDef["kind"], LoopKindStrategy>`:
 *   - `pull`             — the live driver's next-step rule (loop.ts `step`);
 *   - `guardExpectation` — the resume fold's per-row determinism re-check
 *                          (runner/resume.ts `guardRow`);
 *   - `hasPending`       — the resume re-entry announce probe
 *                          (runner/resume-loop.ts).
 * A new loop kind (`panel` is hinted) extends the `LoopDef` union and this
 * table — the `Record` shape makes a missing strategy a compile error — and
 * touches nothing else: dispatch, persistence, cap policy, projection, and
 * completion are kind-agnostic in loop.ts.
 *
 * Also home to the kind-agnostic cursor vocabulary the live driver and the
 * fold share: `LoopCursor`, `advanceCursor` (THE cursor state machine),
 * `unitTagOf`, `judgeStageDef`, `LoopEntry`, `NextStep`.
