/**
 * Loop constructors + introspection — control flow as data, completed.
 *
 * `fanout()` / `iterate()` / `assess()` build the `LoopDef` a stage carries on
 * its single `loop` field; `verify()` builds the `VerifySpec` a stage carries
 * on its `verify` field. Unlike the retired spec-attaching builders (which
 * ATTACHED a `.spec` to a bare function), the LoopDef IS data with
 * function-valued fields — the spec is the source of truth in the
 * constructor, so introspection can never lag a new loop kind. `loopSpecOf`
 * projects the pure-data facet.
 *
 * Constructors validate at construction (the `defineRoute` pattern): a bad
 * `max`, an invalid judge shape, or a non-function `done`/`feedForward`
 * throws immediately at authoring time. Load-time validation re-checks the
 * same rules defensively for hand-rolled literals (jiti erases TS types).
 *
 * Skill-agnostic: the unit detectors (`units`/`next`) are consumer-supplied;
 * rpiv-workflow ships no conventions. Runner-free — safe on `registration`.
