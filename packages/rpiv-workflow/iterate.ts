/**
 * Iterate iteration — the sequential, accumulating dual of `fanout.ts`. When a
 * stage opts in via `StageDef.iterate`, the runner pulls units one at a time
 * (calling the user's `IterateFn` per unit, feeding it the prior units'
 * validated `Output`s) and runs one Pi session per unit. Unlike fanout, each
 * unit runs the stage's `outcome` collector — it reuses `runStageSession`
 * verbatim, so every unit gets the same collector → validate → record →
 * accumulate path as a one-shot `produces` stage.
 *
 * `runner.ts` (via `stage-lifecycle.ts`) injects the runner primitives through
 * `IterateDeps` so this module never imports back (cycle-free), mirroring how
 * `runFanout` receives `FanoutDeps`.
 *
 * Two run-wide bounds are the only safety nets: the generator's own `null`
 * terminator, and `run.maxIterations` (the backstop for a generator that never
 * returns null). No markdown regex, no per-convention counter — rpiv-workflow
 * stays convention-agnostic; the `IterateFn` body owns the convention.
