/**
 * rpiv-workflow — Pi extension entry point.
 *
 * Registers the `/wf` slash command and (optionally) exposes the workflow
 * runtime as a programmatic API for sibling packages that want to
 * contribute built-in workflows via `registerBuiltIns(...)`.
 *
 * Skill-agnostic: the runner sends `/skill:<name>` via Pi's native skill
 * dispatch — workflows can name any skill installed in Pi's search path
 * (`~/.pi/agent/skills/`, `<cwd>/.pi/skills/`, or settings-declared
 * `skillPaths[]`). This package ships ZERO built-in workflows. Bundles
 * like `@juicesharp/rpiv-pi` opt in by calling `registerBuiltIns(...)`
 * from their own extension entry.
