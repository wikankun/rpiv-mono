/**
 * Programmatic built-in workflow registry.
 *
 * Sibling packages contribute their workflows at extension load via
 * `registerBuiltIns(...)`. The loader treats the union as the lowest layer
 * — user and project overlays still override by name.
 *
 * The runner itself ships ZERO built-in workflows. That's deliberate: this
 * package is skill-agnostic, and shipping examples that name skills the
 * user may not have installed would surface as confusing "skill not found"
 * errors. Packages like `@juicesharp/rpiv-pi` opt in by calling
 * `registerBuiltIns(...)` from their extension entry point with workflows
 * that name their own bundled skills.
 *
 * The registry array is anchored on a `Symbol.for` slot on `globalThis`
 * (via `globalSlot`). Pi may load this module more than once — once for the
 * rpiv-workflow extension itself, and once via the rpiv-pi
 * `import { registerBuiltIns } from "@juicesharp/rpiv-workflow"`
 * cross-package resolution — and module-local state would be siloed between
 * those copies. `globalThis[KEY]` is process-wide and survives the dup load.
