/**
 * Host ports — the contract the workflow runtime needs from its host
 * environment, expressed in workflow-domain vocabulary.
 *
 * The package never re-exports `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` types
 * from its public surface. Pi's `ExtensionAPI` / `ExtensionCommandContext`
 * / `ReplacedSessionContext` structurally satisfy these ports, so
 * embedders pass their Pi handles directly without casting; consumers
 * wanting to drive the runtime from a non-Pi adapter implement these two
 * interfaces.
 *
 *  - `WorkflowHost`    — registry-level host (default-export ctor + continue-policy sender).
 *  - `WorkflowHostContext` — per-command ctx passed into `runWorkflow`, also the
 *                        replacement ctx delivered to `newSession`'s `withSession`
 *                        callback. `sendUserMessage` is optional at the type
 *                        level (the outer command ctx may not carry one) but
 *                        the runtime guarantees it is present inside
 *                        `withSession`.
 *
 * Compile-time tripwire: `host.test.ts` asserts Pi's concrete types
 * extend these ports. If Pi's API drifts (a method renames, a signature
 * tightens), `npm run check` fails immediately on that file.
 */

/**
 * Registry-level host. Default-exported function receives this; the
 * runner also uses it for continue-policy stages (sends into the

 *
 * The three methods we touch on Pi's `ExtensionAPI`. Anything beyond
 * these is invisible to the runtime.
