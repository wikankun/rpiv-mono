/**
 * JSONL state at `.rpiv/workflows/runs/<run-id>.jsonl`. Append-only audit
 * trail; every line is a self-contained JSON object. All I/O is
 * fail-soft (logs via console.warn with `[rpiv-workflow]` prefix, never
 * throws).
 *
 * The trail is resume's SYSTEM OF RECORD — `runner/resume.ts` folds the rows
 * back into a `RunState`, so the on-disk shape is a versioned contract, not a
 * debug artifact. The header carries `v` (see `STATE_SCHEMA_VERSION`); resume
 * refuses files written under a different version rather than mis-replaying
 * them. Display readers stay lenient (shape-filtered, skip-on-mismatch).
 *
 * Internally split into three modules:
 *   - paths.ts  — runsDir + stateFilePath + generateRunId
 *   - writes.ts — tryAppendJsonl + writeHeader + appendStage +
 *                 appendRoutingDecision
 *   - reads.ts  — readLastStage + readAllStages + readRoutingDecisions +
 *                 listArtifacts + readHeader + listRuns
 *
 * This file owns the row shapes + types + the public barrel; everything
 * else lives in a focused module.

 * reader (`readAllStagesForResume`) refuses instead — the fold replays these
 * rows as the run's system of record (see the module header).
 *
 * Identity fields:
 *  - `stage` — DISPLAY identity. For single stages this is the workflow
 *    record key; for loop-unit rows it is the decorated human string
 *    (`"implement (phase-2)"`, `"breakdown (r0·judge)"`). Machine readers
 *    must NOT parse it — the structured fields below are the only machine
 *    channel.
 *  - `skill?` — the Pi skill body invoked. Absent for script stages; the
 *    judge's own skill on judge-unit rows.
 *  - `parent?` / `role?` / `unitId?` / `unitIndex?` — present iff the row
 *    records a loop unit. `parent` is the loop stage's record key (the
 *    resume fold + dispatch key on it); `role` says produce vs judge;
 *    `unitIndex` is the 0-based cursor within the generation (== the round
 *    for assess loops); `unitId` is the author-stable unit identity
 *    (`unit.id ?? unit.label`) for fanout/iterate, absent for assess
 *    (identity there is `(role, unitIndex)`). Present on FAILURE rows too —
 *    the resume drift guard consumes failed-trailer identity.
 *
 * The row no longer carries a top-level `artifact` field — discovery
 * moved into the collector, and the canonical artifact list lives on
 * `output.artifacts`. Readers project from there via `listArtifacts`.
