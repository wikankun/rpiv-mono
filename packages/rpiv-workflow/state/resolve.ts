/**
 * Resolve a run *reference* to its header — the ref-resolution seam.
 *
 * Which to call: reach for `resolveRun` when the ref is **user-supplied** (the
 * `/wf @<ref>` token, a CLI arg); reach for `readHeader` when you already hold
 * a concrete `runId` (e.g. straight off `RunSummary.runId`). The split is
 * intent, not behaviour.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *  1. Check the names index (`names.json`) for a name → runId mapping on the
 *     RAW ref. If found and the target JSONL exists, return its header.
 *     If found but the target JSONL is GONE (stale-present entry — a failed
 *     `releaseName` rollback or a hand-deleted run file), that hit is
 *     positive evidence the index is stale: rebuild `names.json` from the
 *     JSONL headers and retry the name lookup once. The rebuild also prunes
 *     the dead entry, freeing the name for re-claim.
 *  2. Fall back to runId lookup via `readHeader`, on the ref normalized to a
 *     slug — a trailing `.jsonl` is stripped and any directory prefix is
 *     dropped (`basename`). This lets `/wf @<path>` accept an editor's
 *     file-autosuggested path to the run's JSONL (`.../runs/<id>.jsonl`),
 *     a bare `<id>.jsonl`, or the plain `<id>` slug interchangeably.
 *  3. Index-miss recovery: if both lookups failed AND the ref is a
 *     well-formed run name absent from the index, rebuild `names.json` from
 *     the JSONL headers (`rebuildIndex`) and retry the name lookup once —
 *     a deleted/corrupt `names.json` no longer orphans named runs. (Gated on
 *     ABSENCE, so it can never fire for the stale-present case — that
 *     recovery lives in step 1.)
 *
 * Name lookup stays on the raw ref: a run name is never a path, so a name like
 * `auth.jsonl` (were it ever claimed) must match verbatim, not as a slug.
 *
 * Fail-soft like every reader — returns undefined when the ref doesn't resolve.
