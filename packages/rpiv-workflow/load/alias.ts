/**
 * Declarative skill-name remapping, applied once at load time.
 *
 * `aliasSkills(w, aliases)` rewrites every dispatching stage whose effective
 * skill (`stage.skill ?? stageName`) has an alias entry, materialising the
 * `skill` field on stages that relied on the stage-key default. Because the
 * remap happens in the loader — before validation and before the runner ever
 * sees the workflow — `/wf` preview, JSONL audit, and the runtime
 * skill-registry preflight all observe the final skill for free; the runner
 * needs no change.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *   - One hop only — looks up `aliases[effective]`, never `aliases[target]`.
 *     No transitive chains, no cycles.
 *   - `run` / `prompt` stages are skipped — they don't dispatch a `/skill:`.
 *     (`fanout` / `iterate` stages carry neither `run` nor `prompt`, so they
 *     ARE dispatching stages and get aliased.)
 *   - Never mutates its input. Returns `w` by reference when nothing changed,
 *     so the shared process-wide built-in registry (anchored on a `globalThis`
 *     slot) is never mutated in place; a changed workflow is a new frozen copy.
