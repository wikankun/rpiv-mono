 *      prompt-dispatch loop is `resolveStagePrompt`, not this projection.
 *   1. The start stage receives `originalInput` (the user's brief).
 *   2. A stage opting out of inheritance (`inheritsArtifacts: false`,
 *      i.e. authored via `terminal()`) also receives `originalInput`.
 *   3. A stage with `reads: [...]` receives the labelled multi-flag form

 *      against `state.named[name].at(-1)`; a multi-artifact entry repeats

 *
 * Returns `undefined` (instead of non-null-asserting) when a required
 * projection input is missing — the rolling primary is unset, or a `reads`
 * name has no published entry. The LIVE path never sees `undefined`: the
 * preflights (`ensureUpstreamArtifact` / `ensureNamedReads`) guarantee the
 * inputs before `inputForStage` delegates here. The RESUME fold freezes this
 * value at loop-generation open, where replayed state is byte-identical to
 * live loop entry (THE REPLAY CONTRACT); `undefined` there means a
 * truncated/corrupted trail and becomes a recorded refusal.
 *
 * Lives here (not runner/) so the resume fold consumes it cycle-free —
 * twin posture to `applyCompletedStage`, the other live+fold shared
