 * `onError` parameter: when given, each provider throw is RECORDED via the
 * callback (the registry stays usable, the caller drains and surfaces);
 * when omitted, a throw rejects the flush promise (trusted in-process
 * providers).
 *
 * Flush semantics: each provider runs AT MOST ONCE, but the flush is not a
 * one-shot process latch — providers registered after a flush run on the
 * NEXT flush, chained after everything that already ran. This is what makes
 * `/reload` work: Pi re-runs extension entries (which re-register their
 * providers) while these slots survive on `globalThis`; the next consumer
 * read then flushes the re-registered providers, so owner-scoped
 * registrations refresh (the contract registry's prune-on-reload semantics
 * depend on this).
 *
 * State (provider list + flush chain) is anchored on `Symbol.for` slots
 * derived from `key`, so a duplicate module load shares one process-wide
 * lifecycle — same rationale as `globalSlot` itself. The chain is a mutable
 * box because the slot value must never be reset to `undefined` (globalSlot
 * would re-init), only its contents.
