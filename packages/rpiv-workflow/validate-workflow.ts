/**
 * Load-time graph validation for `Workflow` objects.
 *
 * Catches the wiring mistakes a TS type system can't reach on its own:
 * unknown edge sources/targets, unreachable stages, missing terminals,
 * predicate functions that return targets outside the stage set.
 *
 * `validateWorkflow` returns a flat array of `WorkflowValidationIssue`s — errors
 * for problems that would crash the runner, warnings for shapes that
 * work but probably aren't what the author intended (unreachable stages,
 * implicit terminals via missing edges). The load pipeline can choose
 * to halt on any error and surface warnings non-fatally.
 *
 * No I/O, no throws — purely a graph walk + predicate probe.
 *
 * Enforcement layers (where each contract channel is adjudicated):
 *   - reads / wiring  → LOAD-TIME, complete (`checkReadsChannelCompat`, all
 *                       publishers, errors on signed mismatch — all stage kinds).
 *   - linear `data` + `status` → RUNTIME (`ensureContractInputValid`).
 *   - produces self-check → PRODUCE-TIME (`extraction.ts:effectiveOutputSchema`).
