 * differ (e.g. a stage keyed `design-after-review` aliasing the
 * `design` skill so it can appear twice in the same workflow's edge graph).
 *
 * Skillless variant: `produces.script({ run, outputSchema?, ... })` runs
 * a pure TS function in place of a Pi skill body. The function returns
 * the `Output<K, D>` envelope directly.
 *
 * Raw-prompt variant: `produces.prompt({ prompt, outcome, ... })` dispatches
 * author-owned text (no `/skill:` prefix) and collects the reply via `outcome`.
 * The typed options omit the dispatch-conflicting fields so invalid combos are
 * un-typable on a literal call site.

 * function in place of a Pi skill body; the runner synthesises a
 * `SideEffectOutput` envelope so the chain stays uniform.
