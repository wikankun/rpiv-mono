/**
 * Public authoring surface for rpiv workflows.
 *
 * A `Workflow` is a typed graph: a named entry point, a node table, and an
 * edge table that maps each node to either another node name, the sentinel
 * `"stop"`, or an `EdgeFn` that picks at runtime. Edges live INSIDE each
 * workflow — there is no parallel preset/edge split.
 *
 * Factories are pure passthroughs that apply sane defaults. Same idiom as
 * `defineConfig` in Vite/Astro/Tailwind: zero runtime cost, exists solely
 * for type inference + uniform shape at the call site.
 *
 * Phase 1 of the TS-native workflow migration — see
 * `thoughts/shared/designs/2026-05-23-ts-native-workflows.md`. This file
 * adds the new surface alongside the existing DAG. Later phases collapse
 * the old paths onto it.
