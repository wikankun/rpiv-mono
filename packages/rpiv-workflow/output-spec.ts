/**
 * Outcome authoring surface — the contract a stage's data-channel
 * implementation satisfies. Decomposed into two orthogonal halves so
 * authors can mix-and-match:
 *
 *   - `ArtifactCollector<B>`      — ENUMERATE: which artifacts did the
 *                                    stage produce? (text scan, tool-call
 *                                    observation, fs diff, git, custom.)
 *   - `ArtifactParser<B, K, D>`   — INTERPRET: given the artifacts, what
 *                                    typed data does downstream see?
 *
 * `Outcome` is the wired-up pair — `{ collector, parser? }` — that
 * stages declare via `StageDef.outcome`. When `parser` is omitted the
 * output data IS the artifact list (kind = `"artifacts"`).
 *
 * Companion to `output.ts` (the envelope `Output<K, D>` that flows to
 * downstream stages, predicates, and the JSONL audit log). The split:
 * output-spec authors implement the producer side here; output
 * consumers read the envelope shape there.

 *   `kind: "ok"` + `artifacts: [...]`            — N>=1 artifacts; parser (or default) shapes the data.

 *
 *   - Genuinely empty (the stage really produced nothing the collector
 *     watches): `{ kind: "ok", artifacts: [] }` — honest empty; the runner's
 *     completion contract decides whether that halts.
 *   - Environment broke MID-STAGE (the channel worked at snapshot time and
 *     fails after — git gone, fs unreadable): `{ kind: "fatal" }` with the
 *     real cause. Returning `ok []` here would let routing/judges act on
 *     fabricated "nothing happened" data.
 *   - Environment absent from the START (snapshot already found no channel —
 *     e.g. not a git repo): degrade to the collector's documented no-signal
 *     shape (`ok []` for diff collectors; `gitCommitOutcome` instead emits
 *     its one sentinel no-op artifact so its parser stays total — the
 *     documented exception). The stage ran outside the watched environment
 *     on purpose; halting would punish a legitimate setup.
