/**
 * Workflow orchestration entry point. `runWorkflow` walks a `Workflow`'s
 * edge graph stage-by-stage; per-stage work (sessions, extraction,
 * validation, audit row writes) lives in sessions.ts + audit.ts. This
 * directory owns graph traversal, per-stage prerequisites, and routing.
 *
 * Modules:
 *  - runner.ts          — runWorkflow + countReachableStages +
 *                         runStageOrRecordFailure + finalizeWorkflow.
 *  - stage-lifecycle.ts — runStage + StagePreflightError + preflight
 *                         pipeline + outcome.resolver.baseline hook.
 *  - chain-advance.ts   — advanceChain + routing audit + backward-jump
 *                         guard + halt-on-error.
 *
 * Ctx lifecycle: every level only touches the ctx it was handed.
 * - `newSession({cancelled: false})` invalidates the outer ctx; all
 *   further work runs on `freshCtx` inside `withSession`, and the
 *   outer function simply unwinds.
 * - `cancelled: true` means no replacement happened — outer ctx remains
 *   valid.
 * - Continue policy has no newSession — same ctx throughout.
 *
 * Vocabulary: "stage" = one stage activation in this run; "phase" = one
 * `## Phase N:` subdivision inside an implement plan artifact.
