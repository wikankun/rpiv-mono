/**
 * `runWorkflowByName` — the ergonomic one-shot entry point.
 *
 * Sugar over the three-step `loadWorkflows` → `findWorkflow` → `runWorkflow`
 * dance for the common "just run this workflow by name" case. Lives in its
 * own module (not `runner.ts`) so the core graph walker stays decoupled from
 * the loader — `runWorkflow` still takes a pre-resolved `Workflow`; only this
 * convenience layer reaches into `load/`.
 *
 * Contract mirrors `command.ts` (the `/wf` handler) so the programmatic path
 * and the slash-command path never diverge:
 *   1. error-severity load issues  → refuse (a broken overlay means the
 *                                     merged set may be partial / wrong)
 *   2. name not found              → failure envelope listing what IS available
 *   3. otherwise                   → delegate to `runWorkflow`
 *
 * Every expected failure is returned as a `RunWorkflowResult` envelope, never
 * thrown — consistent with `runWorkflow`'s own pre-flight rejections and the
 * loader's "never throws" guarantee. Callers branch on `result.success`.
