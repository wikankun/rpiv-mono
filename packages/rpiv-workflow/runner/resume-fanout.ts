/**
 * Fanout-resume dispatch. When a resumed run's trail trailer is a `def.fanout`
 * unit row, `resumeWorkflow` routes here instead of the single-stage arms.
 *
 * Re-calls the stage's `FanoutFn` against the reconstructed entry artifact +
 * state (units never move the primary, so `reconstructState` rebuilt the
 * pre-fanout artifact exactly — for a looped fanout that is the post-loop
 * primary, i.e. the trailing generation's entry), guards that the completed-unit
 * prefix still matches the recomputed unit list, then re-enters `runFanout` at
 * the first not-yet-completed unit. `reconstructState` feeds only the TRAILING
 * generation's prefix, so a second-pass resume compares against the right pass.
 * The fanout's own continuation loop + `advanceAfter` carry the chain onward.
 *
 * REQUIRES the FanoutFn to be deterministic w.r.t. its entry artifact: resume
 * trusts it to reproduce the same unit prefix. A divergence (FanoutFn read
 * mutable external state, or the entry artifact changed under it) is caught by
 * the prefix guard and recorded as a terminal failure — resume refuses to
 * re-run the wrong units rather than guess.
 *
 * `deps` are injected by `resumeWorkflow` (the same `runFanoutSession` +
 * `advanceChain`-backed `advanceAfter` that `tryFanout` injects), so this
 * module mirrors `runFanout`'s primitive-injection shape and imports no cycle
 * back into the session layer.
