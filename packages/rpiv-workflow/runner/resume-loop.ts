/**
 * Loop-resume dispatch. When a resumed run's trail trailer is a loop-unit
 * row (`row.parent` set), `resumeWorkflow` routes here. The fold already
 * verified EVERY unit row (full-row drift guard) and reconstructed the
 * driver's own `LoopCursor`, so re-entry is: derive the frozen entry arg,
 * announce iff work is pending, hand the cursor back to `runLoop`.
 *
 * All four assess pending paths fall out of `pullNext` with the
 * reconstructed cursor — pending judge (grade without re-running the
 * producer), pending produce with a recovered verdict (feedForward, no
 * re-grade), done-verdict fast advance, and round-0 re-run — zero special
 * cases here.
 *
 * The finished-loop resume is a pinned SILENT no-op: no onStageStart /
 * onLoopStart re-fire, no toast (the driver's `ranThisInvocation` rule keeps
 * the banner off; `hasPendingUnit` keeps the announce off). The iterate
 * probe pull is the documented harmless deterministic double-pull.
