/**
 * `resumeWorkflowByRunId` — the ergonomic one-shot resume entry point.
 *
 * Sugar over the `resolveRun` → `loadWorkflows` → `findWorkflow` →
 * `resumeWorkflow` dance, the resume-side counterpart to `runWorkflowByName`.
 * Lives in its own module (not `runner.ts`) so the core graph walker stays
 * decoupled from the loader + state reads — `resumeWorkflow` still takes a
 * pre-resolved `Workflow` + `WorkflowHeader`; only this convenience layer
 * reaches into `load/` and `state/`.
 *
 * Naming: the suffix names the identifier the caller hands in.
 * `runWorkflowByName` resolves a *workflow* by name (you're starting a run, so
 * you say which workflow); `resumeWorkflowByRunId` resolves a specific past
 * *run* by its reference — a human-readable name (assigned via `--name`) or a
 * literal run-id slug. `resolveRun` handles both.
 *
 * The run header already names its workflow, so the lookup is free — the caller
 * supplies only the reference.
 *
 * Contract mirrors `command.ts`'s former resume guards so the programmatic path
 * and the `/wf @<ref>` path never diverge:
 *   1. ref doesn't resolve to a run             → failure envelope (`MSG_RUN_NOT_FOUND`)
 *   2. error-severity load issues                → refuse (a broken overlay may
 *                                                  mis-resolve the workflow) (`MSG_LOAD_ABORTED`)
 *   3. header's workflow no longer loaded        → failure envelope (`MSG_RESUME_WORKFLOW_GONE`)
 *   4. otherwise                                → delegate to `resumeWorkflow`
 *
 * Pure, like `runWorkflowByName` and `resumeWorkflow`: every expected failure is
 * returned in the `RunWorkflowResult` envelope, never thrown and never
 * self-notified. Callers branch on `result.success` and surface `result.error`
 * themselves (see `command.ts`'s `!result.runId` discriminator, which notifies
 * no-JSONL refusals once while leaving in-run failures to the stage machinery).
