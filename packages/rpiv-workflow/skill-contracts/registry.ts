/**
 * Skill-contract registry — global state, providers, and collision tracking.

 * Owns the `Symbol.for`-anchored global slots for the contract registry, lazy
 * providers, failures, collisions, and ownership tracking. The registry is keyed
 * by RESOLVED post-alias skill name (`stage.skill ?? recordKey`), identical to
 * `ensureSkillRegistered` — so a stage's contract lookup follows aliasing for free.
 *
 * Companion modules:
 *   - harvest.ts     — harvestStageContracts + buildEffectiveContracts.
 *   - composition.ts — canCompose + legalNextSkills.
 *   - extension-points.ts — CompositionComparator + OutcomeDeriver registries (consumer extension points).

 *     DIVERGENT contract is recorded (drained into a `LoadIssue` by
 *     `loadWorkflows`), turning a silent last-writer-wins into a visible warning.
 * Omit `owner` for the simple additive behaviour (no prune, no ownership claim).
