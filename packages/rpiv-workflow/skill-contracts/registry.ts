/**
 * Skill-contract registry — global state, providers, and collision tracking.
 *
 * Owns the `Symbol.for`-anchored global slots for the contract registry, lazy
 * providers, failures, collisions, and ownership tracking. The registry is keyed
 * by RESOLVED post-alias skill name (`stage.skill ?? recordKey`), identical to
 * `ensureSkillRegistered` — so a stage's contract lookup follows aliasing for free.
 *
 * Companion modules:
 *   - harvest.ts     — harvestStageContracts + buildEffectiveContracts.
 *   - composition.ts — canCompose + legalNextSkills.
 *   - registries.ts  — CompositionComparator + OutcomeDeriver registries.
 *
 * See `skill-contracts.ts` (pre-split) header for the module-level rationale
 * (global-slot anchoring, provider+flush idiom, etc.).
