/**
 * Union resolver — runs N resolvers and concatenates their artifacts.
 *
 * Useful for the "look in transcript OR tool calls" pattern, or for
 * combining a workspace-diff scan with a transcript URL scan. The
 * sub-resolvers run sequentially; their `baseline` hooks are NOT
 * threaded (each resolver gets its own baseline only if it declares
 * one and is invoked through `Outcome.resolver` directly — wrapping
 * resolvers inside a union loses individual baselines today).
 *
 * Fatal policy: `unionResolvers` returns `fatal` only when EVERY
 * sub-resolver returned fatal (carries the last fatal message for
 * diagnostics). One success is enough for the union to succeed —
 * matches the "any of these channels produced the artifact" mental
 * model the union represents.
 *
 * Empty artifact list from one sub-resolver is treated as `ok` (it
 * just contributes nothing to the concatenation). The union itself
 * returns `ok` with the merged list; the runner's
 * `enforceCompletionContract` decides whether an empty merged list is
 * a halt (produces) or a pass-through (side-effect).
