/**
 * Transcript-path resolver — the lowest-level text-scan primitive.
 *
 * Scans the assistant's spoken text (in reverse) for `pattern`, emits
 * the LAST match as a single `fs` artifact. Caller supplies the regex
 * verbatim — the framework knows zero about any project's layout
 * conventions. Build domain-specific resolvers (rpiv-pi's
 * `rpivArtifactResolver`, an `adrResolver` for `docs/adr/...`, etc.) by
 * wrapping this and supplying the appropriate pattern.
 *
 * The pattern's `g` flag is honoured: with `g`, every occurrence in
 * each text block is considered (helper takes the last one); without
 * `g`, only the first per block. Authors who want N matches → N
 * artifacts compose with `unionResolvers` or write a bespoke resolver.
 *
 * Fatal when no match is found — produces nodes that wire this
 * promise an output, and silently returning zero artifacts hides the
 * agent's failure mode behind a stale primary-artifact.
