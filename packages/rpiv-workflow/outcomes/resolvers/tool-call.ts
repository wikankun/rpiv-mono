/**
 * Tool-call resolver — observes assistant tool_use parts in the branch
 * and turns each into an Artifact via the author-supplied mappers.
 *
 * Universal: knows nothing about specific tool names. Authors wire
 * `match(tc)` to pick which calls are interesting (often
 * `tc.name === "write_file"`) and `toHandle(tc)` to extract the
 * Artifact (most commonly an `fs` handle pulled from the tool input).
 * Multiple matching calls produce multiple artifacts in branch order.
 *
 * Far more reliable than transcript-text scanning: tool-use blocks
 * are the agent's actual recorded actions, not its narration of them.
 *
 * Returns `ok` with an empty list when no matching calls fire — the
 * runner's `enforceCompletionContract` then halts for produces
 * (the stage promised an output and didn't deliver) or passes through
 * for side-effect (chain inherits prior). The resolver itself doesn't
 * second-guess that policy.
