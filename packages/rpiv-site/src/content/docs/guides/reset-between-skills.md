The pipeline's design rests on one operational rule: **every skill boots with a clean context window**. Between any two skill invocations, run `/new` (or whatever your harness calls "clear context") before kicking off the next one.

The artifact-on-disk handoff exists precisely for this reason. Each skill writes its output to `.rpiv/artifacts/<stage>/`, and the next skill reads it back. The chain is durable, not stateful: your next session can pick up a half-finished run without losing context, because state lives in markdown files, not the chat window.

Skipping the reset is the single most common cause of muddled output.

## The reminder pattern

Every skill that hands off to a next step emits a reminder when it finishes:

```
🆕 Tip: start a fresh session with `/new` first — chained skills work best with a clean context window.
```

It applies to every transition in the chain, not just the one you just saw. (The lone exception is `commit`, the chain terminus — it has no next step to remind you about.) The tip is a polite nag; the rule is hard.

## When NOT to reset

One case: **within a single skill invocation**. Several skills run multi-turn work inside one call — `discover` runs a one-question-at-a-time interview, `code-review` dispatches parallel specialist agents, and `blueprint`, `research`, and `explore` each run their own internal checkpoint loops. The reset rule applies between skill *invocations*, never within them.

Every other transition resets. That includes phase-by-phase `/skill:implement` (see below).

## Implementing a multi-phase plan

If your plan has a single phase or is small enough to land in one shot, run:

```
/skill:implement .rpiv/artifacts/plans/<plan>.md
```

This executes every phase in a single invocation. One session, one pass, done.

For larger plans with multiple phases, run **one phase per session** with a reset between every phase:

```
/skill:implement .rpiv/artifacts/plans/<plan>.md Phase 1
```

Then `/new` to reset the context, review the diff, and run the next phase in a fresh session:

```
/skill:implement .rpiv/artifacts/plans/<plan>.md Phase 2
```

The plan artifact carries state between phases. It tracks `- [x]` completion markers as each success criterion lands, so a fresh context per phase keeps the agent focused on the slice in front of it instead of dragging accumulated chat noise from earlier phases.
