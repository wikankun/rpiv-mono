rpiv-pi is the umbrella package. It ships the skill library and runtime infrastructure, but the **tools the skills call** live in sibling Pi extensions (`rpiv-todo`, `rpiv-ask`, `rpiv-web`, and friends). That's why setup is three steps, not one.

## 1. Install the umbrella

From your shell:

```bash
pi install npm:@juicesharp/rpiv-pi
```

The `npm:` prefix tells Pi to resolve the package from the npm registry. Without it, Pi looks for a local path and the install fails.

## 2. Wire the siblings

Start a Pi session in any project, then run:

```
/rpiv-setup
```

`/rpiv-setup` reads `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`, previews every missing sibling plugin alongside any legacy entries to prune, and waits for one confirm before applying. You see exactly what's about to change.

## 3. Restart Pi

Quit and relaunch your Pi Agent session so the freshly-installed siblings load. The skills won't find their tools until the runtime sees the new extensions.

## Quick start: your first skill

Inside Pi, start the pipeline:

```
/skill:discover
```

The `discover` skill interviews you one question at a time to capture intent **before any code is read**. From there, rpiv-pi chains `discover → research → blueprint → implement → validate`. You keep answering questions, the skills do the work.
