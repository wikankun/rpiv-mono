# Changelog

All notable changes to `@juicesharp/rpiv-site` are documented here.

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.20.0] - 2026-06-15

## [1.19.1] - 2026-06-10

## [1.19.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- Workflow framework explainer ("How a workflow works") and a companion narrative blog post ("The workflow author's tale").
- Brownfield guidance section explaining `/skill:annotate-guidance` for onboarding an existing codebase.
- Staggered scroll-in entrance for the flow catalog (honors `prefers-reduced-motion`).

### Changed
- Redesigned the landing page around the `/wf` workflow runner — new hero with a workflow flow graphic plus workflow-focused sections (catalog, run anatomy, stage skills, around-the-flow skills) and refreshed navigation.
- Trimmed the primary nav to its core wayfinding tabs.
- Agent tiers render as a wrapped grid with deduplicated tool chips; around-skill cards now link to their reference pages.
- Workflow guides describe contract-based, numeric routing, and the compose guide derives stage outcomes from skill contracts; `/rpiv-setup` and fanout copy rewritten for accuracy (fanout runs its units sequentially for isolation, not in parallel).
- Docs sidebar scrollbars stay hidden until hover.

## [1.18.2] - 2026-06-04

## [1.18.1] - 2026-06-04

## [1.18.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- New "Right-size the model" guide: per-skill, per-stage, per-preset-stage, and per-agent model and reasoning-effort overrides via `/rpiv-models`.
- Release notes blog post for v1.18.0.

### Changed
- Add release notes blog post for v1.16 → v1.17.
- Update the workflow guides for the v1.18 release: the `/wf @<run-id>` resume verb, resume from a mid-fanout or mid-iterate death, the `runWorkflowByName` / `resumeWorkflowByRunId` helpers and `AbortSignal` cancellation, the typed `STOP` sentinel, the `IterateFn` / `FanoutFn` determinism contract, and the corrected five-workflow (`polish`) count.

### Fixed
- Code blocks in the v1.16 → v1.17 release notes post no longer cause horizontal scroll.

## [1.17.1] - 2026-06-01

## [1.17.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- New authoring guide: "Compose skills as skills" — walks the bundled `polish` workflow as the iterate+prompt capstone, including the four-questions protocol and raw-text prompt dispatch.
- Blogroll rows are fully clickable, with a row-level hover affordance.

### Changed
- Docs reference the unified `.rpiv/workflows/{config.ts, packs/, runs/}` paths and document `skillAliases`.
- Documented the `polish` workflow and the `vet` workflow scope; reflowed code blocks to fit narrow columns.
- Clarified the difference between `design` + `plan` and `blueprint`, and reconciled pipeline path counts.
- Pipeline cards: moved optional/manual tags into the card header, reserved tagline and `collects` heights so COLLECTS / WHY / PRODUCES align row-to-row across panels, and rewrote the WHY copy to give design rationale.
- Unified section headers and ledes into one voice and removed em dashes across rendered copy (headings, taglines, figure captions, pipeline WHY text, and blog excerpts).

### Fixed
- Docs layout: the reading-measure cap now applies only to running text, so code, tables, and images use the full content column; the TOC gets a roomier column on pages with one.
- Agent carousel: drag-to-scroll and arrow / Home / End keyboard navigation now work, and the scrollbar matches the pipeline and sibling scrollers.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-05-14

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- Structured reference pages for skills at `/docs/reference/skills/<slug>` with numbered editorial sections, input/output tables, and key-step rationales.
- Blog post on the discover skill's dialectic A/B study.

### Changed
- `/docs` pages use unified typography tokens and consistent kicker styles across all surfaces.
- Mobile navigation restructured as a three-row grid (brand, utility links, section links) so `/docs` is reachable from phones.

### Fixed
- Mobile `/docs` layout no longer leaks the 3-column desktop grid on articles with a table of contents.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- Documentation site at `/docs` with sidebar navigation, table of contents, and Pagefind-powered search.
- Reference pages at `/docs/reference/skills` and `/docs/reference/agents` auto-render every rpiv-pi skill and subagent from upstream specs.
- Guides covering install and setup, an end-to-end pipeline walkthrough, workflow selection by feature scope, fresh-context discipline, session handoffs, and brownfield codebase onboarding.

### Changed
- Right-rail table of contents on `/docs` has clearer section-label/item contrast and an active-link anchor on the rail.

### Fixed
- Square OG image renders full-bleed; X/Twitter no longer exposes white corners through its circular crop mask.
- Pagefind search panel on `/docs` matches the site's color, type, and motion system and keeps the section nav visible when results are open.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-05-13

### Changed
- v1.5.0 release notes blog post.

### Fixed
- Blog post ordering tie-break using explicit timestamps.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- Blog section with post listing, detail pages, serif prose typography, and RSS feed.

### Changed
- Navigation restructured into a two-tier grid layout with grouped utility links.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-05-11

## [1.4.1] - 2026-05-11

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-10

## [1.3.1] - 2026-05-10

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- GitHub masthead link in the top navigation bar.

### Changed
- Off-scale typography, motion, and radius values consolidated into shared CSS custom properties.
- Skill key parity enforced at compile time; pipeline tokens use `color-mix()` instead of inline `rgba()` literals.

### Fixed
- Muted text color tokens lifted to pass WCAG AA contrast on small monospaced labels.

### Performance
- Critical CSS inlined into HTML to eliminate the render-blocking stylesheet chain.
- Latin woff2 font preloaded to flatten the critical rendering path.
- Scroll-spy offsets cached at layout time to avoid forced reflow during scroll.
- JetBrains Mono self-hosted via Fontsource to remove the third-party CDN render-blocking delay.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- Pipeline section replaced with horizontal emaki disclosure — six scroll-snap panels with a "collects / why / produces" schema per step, plus mouse drag-to-scroll, keyboard navigation, and an IntersectionObserver-driven reveal animation.
- Pipeline section marks `/skill:discover` as optional with a dashed border and muted chip, and expands the ShipLoop section to four skills.

### Fixed
- Pipeline metadata keys are now enforced at compile time — adding a step to the pipeline array without a matching metadata entry fails TypeScript instead of silently omitting the panel's copy at runtime.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- `scope-tracer` agent and `/skill:changelog` skill listed on the agents and skills pages with updated visitor copy.
- Version imprint in the top nav (between brand and section counter) and a quiet “EDITION · vX.Y.Z” line below the colophon rail. Both read from a single `lib/version.ts` that imports the lockstep version from `rpiv-pi/package.json` — the next release bump propagates automatically with zero hand edits. Nav imprint links to the pinned-version page on npm.

### Fixed
- X social card switched to summary + square logo for reliable preview rendering on low-engagement domains.
- Nav version imprint aligned on the same typographic baseline as the brand mark at desktop viewports.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-05-05
