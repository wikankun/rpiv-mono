/**
 * Regression tests for the clean-install chicken-and-egg bug: a top-level
 * static `import … from "@juicesharp/rpiv-workflow"` in rpiv-core/index.ts made
 * the whole extension fail to load when the (peerDependency) sibling was
 * absent, suppressing the /rpiv-setup command + missing-sibling banner that
 * tell the user to install it. The fix defers the dependency behind a guarded
 * dynamic import; these tests pin both the happy path and the absent-sibling
 * no-op.
