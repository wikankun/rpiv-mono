/**
 * Import-graph guard for the clean-install chicken-and-egg invariant: no file
 * statically reachable from the extension entry (index.ts) may VALUE-import a
 * sibling package. A static edge to an absent peerDependency makes the whole
 * extension fail to load, suppressing the very /rpiv-setup command and
 * missing-sibling banner that tell the user to install it (issue #66).
 *
 * Files like built-in-workflows.ts and artifact-collector.ts DO value-import
 * @juicesharp/rpiv-workflow — that is safe only while they stay off the
 * entry's static graph (they are reached via guarded dynamic imports). That
 * invariant was previously enforced by comments alone; this test walks the
 * static import graph from index.ts and fails on any reachable sibling value
 * import. Type-only imports (`import type` / `export type ... from`) are
 * erased at runtime and therefore allowed.
 *
 * Sibling detection reuses SIBLINGS[].matches from siblings.ts — the same
 * single source of truth the presence checks and /rpiv-setup use.
