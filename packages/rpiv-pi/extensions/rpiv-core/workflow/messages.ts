/**
 * User-facing message constants for the /rpiv workflow runtime.
 *
 * Two channels:
 * - `STATUS_*`: persistent status-line text written via `ctx.ui.setStatus`.
 *   Survives the `newSession` transition.
 * - `MSG_*` / `ERR_*`: one-shot announcements via `ctx.ui.notify`. Some may be
 *   repainted by Pi's session transition; the persistent status line above
 *   guarantees the user always knows where the workflow currently is.
 *
 * No imports beyond TS primitives — safe to consume from any layer.
