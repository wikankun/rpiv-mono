/**
 * rpiv-core — Pure-orchestrator extension for rpiv-pi.
 *
 * Composes session hooks and the slash commands. All logic lives in the
 * registrar modules; this file is the table of contents.
 *
 * Tool-owning plugins are siblings (see siblings.ts); install via /rpiv-setup.
 *
 * Workflow runtime + `/wf` command live in `@juicesharp/rpiv-workflow`. We
 * contribute six built-in workflows (ship / build / arch / vet / polish / pr-triage) via the
 * sibling's `registerBuiltIns` programmatic API so they're available to
 * users running `/wf` without authoring their own.
